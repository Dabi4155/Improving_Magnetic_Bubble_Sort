# Improved Magnetic Bubble Sort Algorithm (IMBSA) Paper

This paper presents the "Improved Magnetic Bubble Sort Algorithm" (IMBSA), an enhanced version of the traditional Magnetic Bubble Sort Algorithm (MBSA). The primary focus of the paper is on optimizations designed to improve sorting efficiency, particularly for large datasets with varying levels of redundancy. By introducing the "last swapped" concept and early termination, IMBSA aims to reduce redundant comparisons and swaps, making it more efficient than the original MBSA.

Abstract

In this study, we explore the advancements made to the Magnetic Bubble Sort Algorithm (MBSA) by incorporating optimizations to reduce unnecessary operations. These optimizations, particularly the use of the "last swapped" concept and early termination, enhance the algorithm's performance, especially in datasets with a high degree of redundancy. Our experimental results demonstrate that IMBSA consistently outperforms MBSA across various levels of dataset redundancy, showcasing significant improvements in runtime and overall sorting efficiency.

Key Enhancements

1. Last Swapped Concept
The introduction of the "last swapped" concept is aimed at improving sorting efficiency by tracking the last position where a swap occurred. This allows the algorithm to limit unnecessary comparisons in already sorted portions of the dataset, significantly reducing the number of comparisons required.

2. Early Termination
IMBSA incorporates an early termination strategy, which stops the sorting process once no swaps are made during a pass. This optimization prevents the algorithm from performing redundant comparisons when the dataset is already sorted or nearly sorted.

Experimental Results

Through extensive experimentation, we tested IMBSA against the original MBSA on datasets with varying levels of redundancy. The results indicate that IMBSA consistently outperforms MBSA in terms of runtime, particularly when dealing with large datasets with high redundancy. As the redundancy level increases, the performance gap between IMBSA and MBSA widens, with IMBSA demonstrating a significant reduction in the number of operations required for sorting.

Conclusion

The optimizations introduced in the IMBSA, specifically the "last swapped" concept and early termination, drastically improve the algorithm's efficiency. By reducing unnecessary comparisons and swaps, IMBSA achieves faster sorting times, particularly for large and redundant datasets. Our experiments confirm that IMBSA is a more efficient alternative to the original MBSA, especially when dealing with datasets that have varying levels of redundancy.

Future Work

Future research can explore further optimizations to IMBSA, such as dynamically adjusting the size of the dataset sections to be sorted or implementing parallel processing for even greater performance improvements. The algorithm can also be tested on other types of datasets, including those with a mix of random and sorted elements, to assess its performance in a broader range of sorting scenarios.
